# InfoCrucible - The Multimodal Fake Information Detector  
![InfoCrucible Banner] 
*Advanced Deep Learning System for Detecting Misinformation and Disinformation Across Multiple Modalities*

## 🔍 Overview
**InfoCrucible** is a state-of-the-art deep learning system designed to detect both **misinformation** (unintentional spread of inaccurate content) and **disinformation** (deliberate spread of false information) across multiple modalities including text, images, audio, and video. By analyzing cross-modal contradictions and contextual features, it identifies subtle inconsistencies that indicate synthetic or manipulated content.

## Key Features
- **Multimodal Fusion Architecture**: Combines embeddings from text, images, audio, and video
- **Cross-Modal Attention**: Detects inconsistencies between modalities (e.g., image-text mismatch)
- **Sentiment Integration**: Augments analysis with sentiment scores for text/audio
- **Noise-Robust Pipelines**: Tailored preprocessing for each modality
- **Deepfake Detection**: Identifies synthetic media through temporal analysis
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Optimized for efficient processing of multimedia content
